### Interactive Controls

- **Toggle FullScreen**: Expand or minimize the visualization area for a more immersive experience.
- **Color Code Info**: Display a legend explaining the color codes used during visualization.
- **Sort with Random Algorithm Continuously**: Watch as random sorting algorithms are applied continuously.
- **Sort**: Manually trigger the selected sorting algorithm to see it in action.
- **Reset**: Clear the visualization and reset the array to its initial state.
- **Shuffle Elements**: Randomly shuffle the elements in the array to explore different scenarios.
- **Settings**: Open the settings panel to customize algorithm selection, sorting speed, array size, and element value range.

### Customization Options

- **Set Sorting Algorithm**: Choose from the list of available sorting algorithms to visualize.
- **Set Sorting Speed**: Adjust the visualization speed to observe sorting in real-time or slow motion.
- **Set Number of Elements (Array Size)**: Define the number of elements in the array to be sorted.
- **Set Minimum Value of Elements**: Set the minimum value that elements in the array can take.
- **Set Maximum Value of Elements**: Set the maximum value that elements in the array can take.
